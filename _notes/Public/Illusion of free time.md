Close your eyes, and see how many times in your life when you had a lot of free time and you planned to do things that would make you better. For example, finishing some book you bought and never opened, [[writing]] a book, writing a paper, creating a website, etc. 

These big projects seem promising at first. Then you start comparing what book you should read first, or what topic you should write about, or what technology you should use in your web project. And as time goes by, you spend most of your time on these kinds of activities. When the free time is running out, you realise that you haven't started the actual task. 

Then you realise, there is not enough time to do what you had planned. Then you get angry at yourself. This cycle may happen from time to time in your life. This [[phenomenon]] is called the "illusion and curse of leisure".
