Information overload is a real and present problem for many people. The constant bombardment of new information from technology and the ever-increasing speed of life can be overwhelming. This overload can lead to decreased productivity, decreased quality of work, and even depression. There are a few things that can be done to combat information overload. One is to be more selective about the sources of information that are allowed into one's life. Another is to take breaks from technology and give the mind time to rest. 
Finally, it is important to learn how to effectively filter and process information. The first step to combating information overload is to be more selective about the sources of information that are allowed into one's life. It is important to be intentional about what information is let in. Turn off notifications for email, social media, and news apps. Choose one or two sources for news and information that are trustworthy and stick with them. Be more selective about who you follow on social media and what you allow into your feed. The second step to combating information overload is to take breaks from technology and give the mind time to rest. Go for a walk, read a book, or take a break from screens altogether. Resist the urge to check email, social media, or the news every few minutes. Give yourself permission to disconnect from the constant flow of information. The third step to combating information overload is to learn how to effectively filter and process information. When presented with a deluge of information, it can be helpful to have some sort of system for sifting through it all. One method is to prioritize information based on urgency and importance. Another method is to chunk information into manageable pieces. By learning how to effectively filter and process information, we can lessen the negative impact of information overload in our lives.
