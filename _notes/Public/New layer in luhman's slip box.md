[[Card note-taking systems]] are not a new approach to note-taking from reading.

Atomicity and flexibility are the main features offered by this approach. Especially when we want to arrange cards based on a certain theme and use it as a source in our [[writing]].

The Luhmann's [[slip box system]] provides a new layer for this kind of note-taking approach. It offers a method for developing connections between cards. Instead of storing cards in silos or based on their code/label classes, Luhmann developed an approach to allow cards to communicate with each other.
